Infos on the Radeon Instinct MI50


## General Info
- As far as I'm concerned, there are two 'official' and one unofficial version of the 32gb version of the MI50. The official version has P/N that either ends with '1413'/'1711' and have multiple stickers on the corner of the backplate, while the unofficial ones have one sticker on the backplate and have less cores. I don't know if it works on the unofficial version since both of my cards were the 1413 variant.
- 1413 varient has a yellow dot on the small chip on the back of the GPU near the barcode and a red dot on the small chip near the PCIE slot, while both of the dots on the 1711 varient are green. The 16gb version(P/N: 102D1631410) has a yellow dot near the barcode, and a blue dot near the PCIE slot.
- If your card is beeping, it either means that the power plug is not connected or the gpu temp is too high(there could be more reasons than these two). On Windows before flashing the Bios, my card would overheat while doing nothing and would beep like crazy after around 30 minutes until i shut the whole pc down. I don't know if this issue happenes only on my card or on all cards.

## Issues
- I don't know if this happenes on every card, but having the pc on sleep without the fan on overheats my gpu after a couple of hours for some reason. So test if the gpu is overheating while the pc is on sleep before you leave it without turning the pc off.
